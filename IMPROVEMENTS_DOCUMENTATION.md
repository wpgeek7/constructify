## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Audio Recording Technology:

**Browser API Used:**
```javascript
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true })
```

**How It Works:**
1. Request microphone permission from browser
2. Create MediaRecorder instance with audio stream
3. Capture audio chunks while recording
4. On stop, combine chunks into Blob
5. Convert Blob to File object
6. Upload to Laravel backend via FormData
7. Backend saves to storage and database

**Audio Format:**
- MIME Type: `audio/webm`
- Codec: Opus (high quality, small size)
- Browser Support: All modern browsers
- Fallback: Automatically uses best available codec

**Audio-to-Text Transcription:**
- Infrastructure: ✅ Complete
- Database field: `transcription` in `job_uploads` table
- API Integration: ⏳ Pending (see options below)

**Transcription Options:**

**Option 1: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text** (Recommended)
- Best accuracy
- Supports 125+ languages
- $0.006 per 15 seconds of audio
- Setup: See JOBS_SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md

**Option 2: OpenAI Whisper API** (Popular)
- Excellent accuracy
- Multi-language support
- $0.006 per minute
- Easy to integrate

**Option 3: AWS Transcribe**
- Good for AWS users
- Real-time or batch processing
- Competitive pricing

**To Enable Transcription:**
1. Choose API provider (above)
2. Get API key
3. Add to `.env` file
4. Update `JobController.php` (code examples provided in docs)
5. Audio files will automatically transcribe on upload

### Circular Timer Technology:

**SVG Circle Animation:**
```javascript
// Progress calculation
const circumference = 2 * Math.PI * 90;
const progress = (elapsedTime % 60) / 60;
const strokeDashoffset = circumference - (progress * circumference);
```

**Features:**
- Smooth 1-second animation
- CSS transitions for progress ring
- JavaScript interval for time counting
- Pulsing glow effect with CSS animations
- Gradient background for premium look

**Why Circular Timer?**
- ✅ Better visual feedback than simple buttons
- ✅ Immediately shows if timer is running
- ✅ Professional watch-style appearance
- ✅ Large readable time display
- ✅ Engaging animations keep workers aware
