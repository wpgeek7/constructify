# 📍 Location Tracking in Time Tracking History

## Overview
Every timer action (start, pause, resume, stop) now captures and displays GPS location data in the Reports section, allowing admins to track where employees were when they performed each action.

---

## Features

### 1. **Location Capture** (Worker Side)
- **When**: Every timer action (start, pause, resume, stop)
- **What**: GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude)
- **How**: Automatic background capture with geolocation API
- **Fallback**: Works even if GPS fails (optional field)

### 2. **Location Display** (Admin Reports)
- **Where**: Reports → Job Details → Time Tracking History
- **Format**: `📍 Location: 37.774929, -122.419418 [View on Map]`
- **Accuracy**: 6 decimal places (~10cm precision)
- **Interactive**: Click "View on Map" to open in Google Maps

---

## How It Works

### **Backend (Laravel)**

**Database Schema** (`job_time_logs` table):
```sql
- latitude (decimal, nullable)
- longitude (decimal, nullable)
- action (enum: start, pause, resume, stop)
- action_time (timestamp)
- notes (text, nullable)
```

**API Endpoint**:
```php
POST /api/jobs/{id}/log-time
{
  "action": "start",
  "latitude": 37.774929,
  "longitude": -122.419418,
  "notes": "optional"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Time logged successfully",
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "action": "start",
    "action_time": "2025-10-12 02:27:02",
    "latitude": 37.774929,
    "longitude": -122.419418,
    "user": { "id": 1, "fullname": "John Doe" }
  }
}
```

---

### **Frontend (React)**

**Worker Dashboard** - Captures location:
```javascript
const handleTimerAction = async (jobId, action) => {
  let location = null;
  try {
    location = await getCurrentLocation(); // GPS capture
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn('Location not available'); // Continue without GPS
  }
  
  await axios.post(`/api/jobs/${jobId}/log-time`, {
    action,
    latitude: location?.latitude || null,
    longitude: location?.longitude || null
  });
};
```

**Admin Reports** - Displays location:
```jsx
{log.latitude && log.longitude && (
  <div className="location-info">
    <span className="location-icon">📍</span>
    <span className="location-text">
      Location: {log.latitude.toFixed(6)}, {log.longitude.toFixed(6)}
    </span>
    <a 
      href={`https://www.google.com/maps?q=${log.latitude},${log.longitude}`}
      target="_blank"
      className="view-map-link"
    >
      View on Map
    </a>
  </div>
)}
```

## User Interface

### **Admin View (Reports Section)**

1. Go to **Reports** tab
2. Click **"View Details"** on any job
3. Scroll to **"⏱️ Time Tracking History"** section
4. Each event shows:
   - Employee name
   - Action badge (START, PAUSE, RESUME, STOP)
   - Timestamp
   - **📍 GPS Location** (with map link)
   - Optional notes

**Example Display**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ● John Doe [START] 10/12/2025, 2:27:02 AM │
│                                             │
│ 📍 Location: 37.774929, -122.419418         │
│    [View on Map]                            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Benefits

### **For Admins:**
✅ **Verify Location** - Ensure workers are at the correct job site
✅ **Time Accuracy** - Cross-reference GPS with reported times
✅ **Dispute Resolution** - Objective evidence of worker presence
✅ **Compliance** - Meet contractual location requirements

### **For Workers:**
✅ **Automatic** - No manual location entry needed
✅ **Transparent** - Know location is being tracked
✅ **Fail-Safe** - Timer works even if GPS fails

---

## Privacy & Permissions

### **GPS Permission:**
- Browser prompts for location access on first timer action
- Workers can allow or deny
- If denied, timer still works (location will be null)

### **When Location is Tracked:**
- ✅ Only during timer actions (start, pause, resume, stop)
- ✅ Live tracking while timer is running (every 5 seconds)
- ❌ NOT tracked when timer is stopped
- ❌ NOT tracked when app is closed

### **Data Storage:**
- Location stored in backend database
- Linked to specific job and user
- Only admins can view location data
- Workers cannot see their own location history

---

## Troubleshooting

### **Location Not Showing:**

1. **Check Browser Permission:**
   - Settings → Site Settings → Location → Allow
   
2. **Check GPS Signal:**
   - Move to outdoor area for better signal
   - Wait 10-15 seconds for GPS lock

3. **Check Backend Logs:**
   ```bash
   tail -f backend/storage/logs/laravel.log
   ```

4. **Check Browser Console:**
   - Press F12 → Console tab
   - Look for geolocation errors

### **Common Issues:**

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Location permission denied" | User blocked GPS | Grant permission in browser settings |
| "Location timeout" | Weak GPS signal | Move outdoors or near window |
| "Location not supported" | Old browser | Update browser to latest version |
| "Location shows 0, 0" | No GPS lock yet | Wait 10-15 seconds and try again |

## Technical Details

### **GPS Accuracy:**

| Decimal Places | Accuracy | Example Use |
|----------------|----------|-------------|
| 4 | ~11 meters | City-level |
| 5 | ~1.1 meters | Street-level |
| **6** | **~0.11 meters** | **Building-level** ⭐ |
| 7 | ~1.1 cm | Survey-grade |

**We use 6 decimal places** for optimal accuracy while keeping data size reasonable.

### **Location Tracking Flow:**

```
1. Worker clicks "Start Timer"
   ↓
2. Frontend requests GPS coordinates
   ↓
3. Browser prompts for permission (first time only)
   ↓
4. GPS coordinates captured (or null if failed)
   ↓
5. POST request to backend with action + location
   ↓
6. Backend saves to job_time_logs table
   ↓
7. Live tracking starts (updates every 5 seconds while running)
   ↓
8. Worker clicks "Stop/Pause"
   ↓
9. Final location captured
   ↓
10. Live tracking stops
```

## Testing

### **Test Location Capture:**

1. **Login as Employee:**
   ```
   Email: employee@example.com
   Password: your_password
   ```

2. **Navigate to Dashboard** (should see assigned jobs)

3. **Click "Start Work" on any job**
   - Browser should prompt for location permission
   - Grant permission

4. **Wait 5-10 seconds**

5. **Click "Pause" or "Stop"**
   - Should show success message

### **Verify in Admin Reports:**

1. **Login as Admin:**
   ```
   Email: admin@constructify.com
   Password: Admin@123
   ```

2. **Go to Reports tab**

3. **Click "View Details" on the test job**

4. **Scroll to "Time Tracking History"**
   - Should see GPS coordinates for each action
   - Click "View on Map" to verify location on Google Maps

## Future Enhancements

### **Planned Features:**
- [ ] **Geofencing** - Alert if worker is outside job site radius
- [ ] **Location History Map** - Visual timeline on map
- [ ] **Travel Distance** - Calculate travel between locations
- [ ] **Offline Support** - Queue locations and sync when online
- [ ] **Battery Optimization** - Adjust GPS frequency based on battery
- [ ] **Location Verification** - Admin approval if outside expected area

### **API Extensions:**
- [ ] GET `/api/jobs/{id}/location-history` - Fetch all locations for a job
- [ ] GET `/api/jobs/{id}/location-heatmap` - Generate heatmap data
- [ ] POST `/api/jobs/{id}/set-geofence` - Define acceptable radius

---

## Security Considerations

### **Access Control:**
✅ Only authenticated users can log time
✅ Only admins can view location data
✅ Location data encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
✅ Database access restricted by Laravel auth

### **Privacy Compliance:**
✅ Workers are notified of location tracking
✅ Location only tracked during work hours
✅ Workers can opt-out (timer still works)
✅ Data retention policy can be configured
